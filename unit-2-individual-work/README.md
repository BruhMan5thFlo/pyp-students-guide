Aside from classes and group projects, there's some individual work that you'll need to complete. This will include things to read, videos to watch and coding assignments to complete.

All the individual work is carried on our [Learn Platform](https://learn.rmotr.com). We're constantly pulling your progress so it'll be available also in your Students Dashboard.

Check the video guide included in this lesson to have a general overview of how the learn platform works. In following lessons, we'll explain how to read tests and check the source code of each learn lesson.
