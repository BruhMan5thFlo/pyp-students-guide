# Introduction

We're so excited to start this journey with you! Getting started with Python is an amazing experience. Python is a really versatile language that can be used for Web Development, System Automation, Data Science, Machine Learning, or pretty much any other usage you need to give it. It's also a great language to get started with Programming, thanks to its beautiful and well designed structure.

**We're here to give you the BEST experience with programming** If you have any issues, please let us know. Our only goal is for you to learn as much as you can during this course. **We're here to help**.

## How our course works

This course has been carefully thought and planned. We've done over 11 editions and we've perfected every detail of it. Said that, we're always open to feedback and we're constantly improving our process and methodology, so feel free to reach out.

**The only thing you need to do before class is** reading going through the learn units of the topics covered in the class, and try to read about them. We want you to have a minimal notion about what we'll be talking during class. That way you'll take the most out of our explanations and you'll have the chance to ask good questions. So, for example, before our first class you should read from [Introduction](http://learn.rmotr.com/python/introduction-to-programming-with-python/introduction/introduction) up to [Introduction to Functions](http://learn.rmotr.com/python/introduction-to-programming-with-python/functions-intro/introduction).

You don't need to worry about the programming exercises. We'll work on them together during the coding sessions. We want you to have our mentor's support while you resolve them.
