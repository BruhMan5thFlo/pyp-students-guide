# Code of Conduct

You'll be sharing this class with many people from different parts of the world. We have an incredibly friendly and supporting environment, and we want to keep it that way. Please read the **[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/rmotr/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md#contact-information)** thoroughly because it has everything that you need to know in case of breaches or uncomfortable situations.

## TL;DR

We're a group of **good people** trying to learn. Our environment should be friendly and supportive. If you feel that's not respected, [get in touch with us](https://github.com/rmotr/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md#contact-information) ASAP and we'll deal with the situation.

**We do not tolerate harassment or breaches to the CoC in any form**
