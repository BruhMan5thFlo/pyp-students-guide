# Pre-class material

We use this same platform ([learn.rmotr.com](http://learn.rmotr.com/)) to include the readings and exercises before class. For each class, **we'll give you a set of _Units_ to complete**. A _unit_ contains a lesson including the readings to do (usually with the name _Introduction_ and coding exercises to complete). Here's an example of a unit in learn.rmotr.com:
