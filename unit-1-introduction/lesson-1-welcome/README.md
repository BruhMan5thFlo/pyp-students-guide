Welcome to rmotr.com! This guide will help you keep track of how things work in a rmotr.com course.

> Please feel free to suggest things we could include in this guide. This guide is backed in a **public and open source** [Github repo](https://github.com/rmotr-curriculum/pyp-students-guide) and everyone can contribute to it.

This guide has a lot of content, and we're constantly updating it. You don't need to read/watch everything right now, but there are a few important things to start with:

* [How to use your students dashboard](/python/rmotrcom-students-guide/introduction/students-dashboard): This is **FUNDAMENTAL**. Your student's dashboard is your go-to place for every resource at RMOTR.
* [Code of Conduct](/python/rmotrcom-students-guide/introduction/code-of-conduct): Equally important, please make sure you read and understand it before starting the course.
* [Required tools to start the class](/python/rmotrcom-students-guide/introduction/required-tools): What to install and have ready before the class starts.
* [How to get help](/python/rmotrcom-students-guide/introduction/how-to-get-help): How and to whom reach out for help.

You might also find interesting our:

* [Individual work guide](/): how the learn platform works and how to read tests.
* [Group Project Guides](/): How Group Projects work (including installing libraries, github workflow, etc).

## Communication

While reading these lines, while working on an individual assignment, or when that shower thought pops up: you can always reach out to us. If you don't understand something, or you have a question, saw a bug or possible improvement, or any other reason: **get in touch**. See the next section about "How to get help" to get more details about it.

## How this guide is structured

This website/platform you're currently browsing is what we call _**learn**_. All the content we provide will be hosted on this platform, so we want you to feel comfortable with it. We hope it's intuitive enough to follow. Basically, _**learn**_ has many "courses" (like this one you're browsing). Each course has a set of Units (high level) and each unit has many different "lessons". Each lesson can be either a "reading" lesson (like this one you're currently reading) or an "assignment lesson" that is basically a lesson that has a coding exercise that you can submit in place. ([See an example](http://learn.rmotr.com/python/advanced-python-programming-class-material/introduction/your-first-coding-assignment)). The following diagram will explain it better:
