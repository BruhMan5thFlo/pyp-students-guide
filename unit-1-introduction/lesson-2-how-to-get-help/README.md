# How to Get Help?

Communication is key at rmotr. It's our core value. We encourage you to reach out whenever you have a question or any particular comment. Let's start with the technical requirements to communicate: slack.

## Slack

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is our main communication tool; **everything happens on Slack**. You can [download](https://slack.com/downloads) apps Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS, Android and Windows Phone. If you don't want to download a particular client/app, you can always use the browser version: [rmotr.slack.com](https://rmotr.slack.com/).

#### Slack channels

Slack has many useful channels that you can browse to discuss freely about different topics (**#general**, **#djangonauts**, **#flaskers**, **#pythoners**, etc). But there are two particular channels that are the most important ones: **#mentors-help** and your own cohort's channel.

##### Mentors help

This channel is the main one used to get help from mentors. Just join the channel and send your questions by prepending your messages with the token `@here` (this will send notifications to logged in mentors):

##### Your group's channel

At rmotr, you'll be part of the same group during the entire course. Your group will have its own slack channel. It's a good place to share with your team whatever you want. For example, this is the Intro to Python channel from January's cohort:
