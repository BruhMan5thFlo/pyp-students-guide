# Requirements

We've tried to minimize the requirements for our course as much as possible. That's why you can take our course with _virtually_ any device. Of course that the recommended setup will include a decent laptop/desktop pc, but there are no requirements about a certain Operating System to use.

**All this tools should be FREE** (Don't pay for anything unless you're willing to do so, it's not required for class)

## Class videoconference

We use [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for our classes and coding sessions. Zoom can be used in a wide variety of clients. Just download and install your preferred one from here: [http://zoom.us/download#client_4meeting](http://zoom.us/download#client_4meeting). It's a good idea to also install a mobile app. If you are ever running late to class, you can use it on the go.

## Github account

You'll need a Github account to have access to the repositories. To create your account go to this page: [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join).

After you register you'll see your github username at the top-right corner of the site, as you can see in this picture (my username is `santiagobasulto` and it's next to my picture):

If you click on that link you should go to your profile page. There's more information there. This is how mine looks like:

## Cloud9

Create an account in [Cloud 9](https://c9.io/signup). It's the collaborative IDE we'll use during our classes to work together. The account is FREE. They'll ask you to put a Credit Card to validate you're a real person, but they **will not charge you**. If you don't have a credit card at hand, get in touch with us (or your TA) to bypass this limitation (we need to get in touch with C9).

## Setting up your RMOTR account

Once you confirm your spot you'll receive a link to signup in our private platform. The signup process is really simple and the only thing you have to do is login with your Github account:
