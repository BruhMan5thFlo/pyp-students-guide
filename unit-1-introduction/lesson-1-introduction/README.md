# Introduction

Welcome to rmotr.com! This guide will help you keep track of how things work in a rmotr.com course.

> Please feel free to suggest things we could include in this guide. This guide is backed in a **public and open source** [Github repo](https://github.com/rmotr-curriculum/pyp-students-guide) and everyone can contribute to it.

## Pre-class readings and exercises

As you know, we have 1 class per week (4 classes in total). There are a few things to do before every class. **First, we'll ask you to read about the contents that will be covered**, in order to go to class knowing at least the fundamentals about them. We'll expand on those contents during the class, but we don't want you to go to class without ever hearing about them. For example, before the class about **collections**, we want you to at least have read about **lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc**. Maybe you don't know when it's better to use a list or a tuple, or that a dictionary is implemented using a [Hash Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table), but you at least know what they are and it'll sound familiar when we talk about more advanced stuff.

**Readings and coding exercises are MANDATORY. We'll assume you've gone through them before class*

We'll also ask you to test your own knowledge by working on a few individual exercises. The reasoning is that, after you've read some new Python topics, you want to put them into practice. There's no better way to raise questions (that will be answered during class), than by trying to make something work.
